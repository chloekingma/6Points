							<p>Originally from Melbourne, Australia in the 21st century my cultural background could be accurately described as “Contemporary” as I have travelled to all continents with the exception of Antarctica. My education up to this point is fairly low after graduation of V.C.E in 2001. I am English speaking only with a basic understanding and formal greetings of most countries I have visited. I found that using your head, not getting "hot headed" and going with the flow takes you a long way when travelling.

An interesting occurrence during travel in July, 2016 when I in my first day of visiting Turkey a military coup was acctivated. It was my first experience of the internet literally being severely censored by the incumbent Turkish government blocking off access to almost all websites and any and all use of social media, the only internet service that received no ill affect’s during the first 12 hours of the coup was email, I was able to communicate unhindered through my Hotmail.com account with no problems what so ever. An interesting twist to the whole saga was 2 days after the "coup" was over with, the Turkish goverment gave the people of Turkey free mobile phone "data" for an entire laugh, that was something that me "laugh" although I did not mention it to anyone at the time.</p>
