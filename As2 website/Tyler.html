							<p>I have been exploring the abilities of IT for a while now though I have never really delved into any sort of system or program with fears of doing something wrong (I once tried to install a new SSD into my PC and got blue screened). 
I mostly watched a lot of Youtube videos of other people using their IT knowledge for a humorous outcome, such as people playing video games or using robotics and computer components to create outrageous or even useless inventions. I found these a lot easier to learn from than just a regular tutorial. 
RMIT popped up as an Instagram ad for me as I was scrolling through one day so I decided to look into it more through Open Universities Australia. As I was going through researching the courses that RMIT provides I came across the Bachelor of IT. After looking through the course criteria I noticed that I could do two of the core subjects to be able to study the bachelor, this got my interest and I decided within a week to sign up for the next semester. My hopes are that this study will lead to new career opportunities and expand my knowledge of IT as a whole.</p>
