							  <p> <h2>About me</h2>
							  </P>
							<p> Growing up in country Victoria, I am 2nd generation Australian with my family originating from Wales. I have a beautiful wife, Lucy, two amazing young boys - Felix (4), Charlie (2) and an Australian Bulldog named Rupert. 
 
I’m currently employed by an Australian Government Agency, working in a Specialist Operations team. My historical vocational background includes military, tactical, technical and covert operations - Covering disciplines as diverse as electronic engineering to espionage. 
 
My Interests and hobbies include most sports, particularly basketball and AFL football. Unfortunately, due to numerous injuries, sustained both vocationally and in my sporting pursuits, I now limit myself to my other passions, long range shooting, fishing, golf, and beer brewing. 
 
My interest in IT primarily stems from my vocation and the advancement of my technological aptitude, derived from career progression and the evolution of said industry. 
 
More specifically my interests in the IT industry are now structured towards research and development including software (programming), hardware (electronic engineering) and the symbiosis between the two disciplines.

						<h2>MC / Online psychometric testing results</h2>
						</P>
				<p>
					It’s an interesting concept and it does reflect many of my inherent traits but at the same time it also missed the mark in some areas. For me personally, the results did establish some interesting internal reflection, focusing on my strengths and weaknesses characteristic to my attributed profile.  
 
The learning style test was an accurate assessment of how I envisage myself against the exercise parameters. I'd even say the 2 primary attributes, evenly split (37.2 % each) between the Theorist and Reflection attributes, was a good indication of how I see myself in this particular test.
 
Of course, inconclusive results are expected given any limited psychoanalysis, but it does provide our team a metric into my personality profile and a scope in relation to how I would fit into a working environment. 
 
Myers Briggs test - Advocate (Assertive) 
With phrases such as: inborn sense of idealism and morality, capable of taking concrete steps to realise their goals and make a lasting positive impact. One can see why this is a unique profile (1% of the population). I feel in essence, sentiments like this are grandiose, but I believe I do relate to a fair few of the outlined traits in this sub-category.
 
A few examples in areas where I differ slightly to their perceived traits for an Advocate. 
Advocates find it easy to make connections with others – I think I can relate to others well, but this is different to making a connection. 
 
Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas to Advocate personalities. - Whilst this is true for me, the formative example; “These types tend to believe that nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants”. Is an overly simplistic and somewhat illogical argument.  Personally, I am more of a realist than an idealist. 
<br>
A few traits that I definitively relate to; 
					<ul>
						<li> Private (closed book) </li>
						<li> Don’t readily communicate feelings </li>
						<li> Requires patience from others to get to know an advocate </li>
						<li> Avoid most social situations </li>
						<li> Demands integrity and honesty </li>
						<li> Thinks outside the box – productive but works on different tangents to the norm. </li>
				        </ul>

</br>

These introverted traits can make it extremely difficult for myself and my team-mates in relation to communication. I will always stay in the shadows and this may frustrate some other personality types.  
 
In my professional sphere, this characteristic is referred to as the ‘grey man’. In saying this I will always play my role, providing valuable and creative input. My innate drive to work hard and desire to see my team succeed, will always override any negative’s stemming from my reluctance to be more than a voice in the background. 
 
I’m quietly confident in my abilities and I tend to hold back until I need to present my viewpoint, or my assistance is asked for. 
 
I’m a natural leader by empowerment and I will only become assertive when I determine it's required. I work well in team environments due to my nature, but being highly introverted, I will certainly let others lead and direct proceedings, unless I feel it will be detrimental to the group.
