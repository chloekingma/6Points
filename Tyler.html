							<p>I have been exploring the abilities of IT for a while now though I have never really delved into any sort of system or program with fears of doing something wrong (I once tried to install a new SSD into my PC and got blue screened). 
I have mostly watched alot of Youtube videos of other people using their IT knowledge for a humorous outcome, such as people playing video games or using robotics and computer components to create outrageous or even useless inventions. I found these a lot easier to learn from than just a regular tutorial. 
RMIT popped up as an Instagram ad for me as I was scrolling through one day so I decided to look into it more through Open Universities Australia. As I was going through researching the courses that RMIT provides I came across the Bachelor of IT. After looking through the course criteria I noticed that I could do two of the core subjects to be able to study the bachelor, this got my interest and I decided within a week to sign up for the next semester. My hopes are that this study will lead to new career opportunities and expand my knowledge of IT as a whole.</p>

								<h2>Personality & Learning test results</h2>
							 </p>
							 <h4>Meyers-Briggs 16 Personalities</h4>
							 <p>The result of my Meyers-Briggs 16 personalities test was, INTJ-T Architect, The test also states that this is one of the rarest personality types making up just two percent of the population and an even rarer 0.8% in women. Refer to 16personalities.com/intj-personality.
								With my understanding, we see INTJ-T’s while preferring to work alone can work in small groups of like-minded people who would help them progress towards a similar vision.
								Being an arrogant and judgemental personality type could make other group members hesitant to have input. This comes as a weakness especially for group work, it is an area I would need to be conscious of as this could impact group work negatively.
							 </p>
							<h4>Vark Learning style test</h4>
							<p>	The test I have chosen to take for learning styles comes from VARK, an acronym for Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic. This test indicates that I am a multimodal type learner, this means that I can use many different formats of learning but prefer visual formats, such as using graphs and diagrams, listening and discussing or practical exercises and experiences.
								The use of the multimodal learning style within a group could prove beneficial due to the adaptability of it. If other members of a group are more inclined to use 1 or 2 specific learning styles I will be able to adapt to help the process of the project move along smoothly and efficiently.
								I do still prefer visual learning styles such as videos, diagrams, or instructions. I find these much easier to follow, and being able to recreate the scenario for myself by seeing the result in front of me.
							</p>
							<h4>Enneagram Personality test</h4>
							<p>The result of my Enneagram test is five, the investigator. Five's have two key motivations, ‘to seek understanding and knowledge’.(truity.com, para, 6.) They are perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated. They can concentrate and focus on developing a complex idea or skill but can also become preoccupied with their thoughts and imaginary constructs, thus becoming detached. They need to have everything figured out, this acts as a defence mechanism from threats that may arise within their environment. Refer to information provided by enneagraminstitue.com.
								Becoming detached from the group would be detrimental to myself and all involved, On the positive side, the ability to concentrate and stay focused throughout the group project will be a great benefit.
								
								<br>Although the results of these tests aligned with many of my personality and learning characteristics there are still some variances. This does not mean that the tests are invalid, but they still require further testing to be improved on. This will yield more accurate results. In saying this, these tests should still be taken lightly and with an open mind.
								The results of the tests are relevant to how I work now whether in a group or not, but do pose a lot of negatives in regards to group work. The negatives such as becoming detached or being too arrogant will be something that I will need to work on and be conscious of going forward into group work.
