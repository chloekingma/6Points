								<h1></a>The 6 Points Group Profile. </h1>
								<p>In this website you can find information on all 6 members of the group and a summary of our group idea.</p>
								<p>You will also find that when comparing all of the members ideal jobs that they are similar in many senses. Three of the groupâ€™s members are to be developers in some aspect or another, two of them intend on having the same job as cyber security analysts and the other is working with machine learning. All of these jobs involve a developmental aspect, be it developing a game, website, program or penetration testing. We all have a similar plan of studying to further our knowledge so that we may be able to attain our ideal jobs in the near future. </p>

									<h1>Project Idea</h1>
									<h3>Automated Aquaponics system</h3>
									<p>Our project is an automated aquaponics farm, this means that many of the elements of the farm such as temperature control, lighting, and even feeding will not be done by manual labour but will instead be done by making use of automated systems. These systems will be programmed to perform their required tasks at certain intervals. For example; the lighting system can be programmed using a daylight sensor that turns the lights on once the sensor can no longer detect any daylight. 
									</p>
									<p>The expected outcome for this is that there will be an almost fully automated, efficient, and sustainable method of aquaculture. The system will also be cyclical, the water waste from the fish tanks will be used as water fertiliser for agricultural crops such as vegetable farms. The water is then filtered by these farms and is returned back to the fish tanks for another cycle. This aims to reduce water waste and increase food production

For our artefact we will be creating a small-scale system that demonstrates the very basic and core functionalities of the described automated aquaponics farm. We will be using mostly a Raspberry Pi for this and any other technological aspects we may see fit. We aim to have a semi-automated miniature scale of the system which can be easily interpreted and adapted to large scale farms someday. While the artefact will be kept simple due to time restrictions, we will hopefully develop it to be complex enough to perform the core functionalities as mentioned before.
