								<h1></a>The 6 Points group profile. </h1>
								<p>In this website you can find information on all 6 members of the group and a summary of our group idea.</p>
								<p>You will also find that when comparing all of the members ideal jobs that they are similar in many senses. Three of the group’s members are to be developers in some aspect or another, two of them intend on having the same job as cyber security analysts and the other is working with machine learning. All of these jobs involve a developmental aspect, be it developing a game, website, program or penetration testing. We all have a similar plan of studying to further our knowledge so that we may be able to attain our ideal jobs in the near future. </p>

									<h1>Project Idea</h1>
									<h3>Automated Aquaponics system</h3>
									<p>Automated filtering and monitoring system for fish farms using technology such as Raspberry Pi. The goal is to create a minimum waste food cycle - water and fish waste from fish farms will be transported to flood tanks where the water can be stored and used to water vegetable farms, this provides nutrient rich fertiliser for the plants.<br> The plants in turn filter the water until aerated, clean water is transported back to the fish tanks to start the cycle anew. This reduces waste production and water loss as well as providing an automated system for food production to help feed our ever-growing population.<br>
										</p>
										<b>Within this cycle there will be FOUR automated systems</b>
										<br>
										<br>
										<li><b>1:The fish feeder</b> - this can be programmed to feed the fish during certain times in the day in order to keep them healthy and regularly fed.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li><b>2: The pump</b> - which pumps the waste water from the fish tank to the flood tank - this will be triggered by an ammonia sensor which monitors the ammonia levels in the fish tanks (caused by decomposing organic matter such as fish excrement) and once the levels exceed what is recommended for fish tanks, between 0.001 mg/L to 0.020 mg/L the water will be flushed.
											<br><a href="https://answers.seneye.com/en/water_chemistry/what_is_ammonia_NH3_NH4/what_ammonia_level_is_safe">Reference link</a>
										</li>
										<br>
										<li><b>3: Hydroponic lights</b> - these lights are used for aquarium plant growth especially at night time when there is no sunlight. Therefore the automated system for these lights will have a daylight sensor and once it gets too dark the system will turn on the hydroponic lights.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li><b>4: Thermostat</b> - the average recommended temperature of a freshwater fish tank is between 23-27 degrees celsius for tropical fish or using no heating system for coldwater fish as water should be kept at around 15 degrees celsius.
											However, the temperature should be adjusted accordingly to the specific type of fish living in the tank. The thermostat will be automated to keep the temperature between these ideal levels to allow for the best conditions for the fish. If the temperature drops below or rises above the recommended temperature then the tank’s heating system will be adjusted accordingly.

										<br>
										<br>
										<li><b>Advantage of Automation</b> - This system is more efficient than standard aquaculture as it is more sustainable with greater food yields in both the fish and the vegetables. This system efficiently makes use of finite resources such as water by reusing the water within this cycle, the system can also be further improved upon by using the Raspberry Pi to gather data and information of each version of the system to improve upon it in the next to allow for even greater sustainability, efficiency, and food yields.
										</li>
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Tools and Technologies required</b>
										<p>
											This Project will need Raspberry Pi's On WiFi and a power source to power them, they will be controlled through a main computer which will give them commands to follow. You will need greenhouses, grow beds, fish tanks, pipes, flood tanks, hydroponic lights, an ammonia sensor, pumps, and fish food feeders all these will also require a power source. Secondly you will need to have software Linux Raspbian to run them, as for the AI aspect, Python coding is best as its coding is a lot easier and efficient.
										</p>
										
										<br>
										<b>Skills Required</b>
										<p>
											For the project to succeed you will need to wire and install the modules and powersource, build a greenhouse and a flood tank stand, have a big fish tank, perhaps a rain water tank could be used. You will need to know how to write all the software to automate the fish feeder, thermostat, pump and hydroponic lights. Also required would be the knowledge to write the AI program once you have enough data collected. This project is very feasible regarding the required skills. It is possible to learn programming and AI through the internet or through obtaining a degree in IT, as for hardware all the parts can be obtained through ebay and Amazon.
										</p>
											
											<br>
											<b>Outcome</b>
											<p>
												If the project is successful an completely automated farm that produces fish and vegetables will come into existence, providing a good foundation for sustainable and mass food production to aid in the world hunger problem. This development, if expanded and made into a large producer with automating planting of seeds, will cut out the expensive labour aspect of farming allowing for cheaper food prices and making food more available to those in low-income situations.
